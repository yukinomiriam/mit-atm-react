 DESCRIPTION
------------
This project is a small simulation of an ATM where you can either deposit or withdraw money.

As part of our assignment, we had to make certain changes that would improve the UI and the behavior.

For my UI changes I did the following:
•	Added a gradient background
•	Created an added a container for the main fields and text.
•	Changed the font.
•	Added a greeting at the top.
•	Changed the wording for some labels.
•	Added some jQuery to add/display a custom greeting.
•	Added Bootstrap and custom CSS.

For the back-end changes:
•	Added logic that will display either Cash Deposit or Cash Back fields depending on the option selected from a dropdown.
•	Validated that the user is not allowed to withdraw more money than the available in the account balance.
•	Submit button is disabled if not amount is entered.
